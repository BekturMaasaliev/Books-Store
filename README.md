# Online book store

### Is the prototype of an online bookstore. A json-server on port 8888 is used as the database. All data in db.json is stored in json format. There is pagination, crud, live search is available. The project is a learning project (developed it when I was just learning js)

<br>

## Json-server:
### in this project, there is its own fake database with a server called: json-server. In it you can create the same API queries as in the real database. All data are stored in json format. Enter the command to start the server:
**`npm install json-server`**

**`npx json-server --watch db.sjon --port 8888`**
### json-server - keyword 
### db.json - name of file as a database
### 8888 - port on which the server will run

## Hope you have no trouble using my react application. Happy hacking!
